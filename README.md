# Overview

In this project I practiced using CRUD with Firebase which is a Cloud database.

This is a mini version of a Ride-share app that I am working on. It is a React Native Expo App that has a login screen, register screen, add rides, display rides, and update ride info. It uses authentication and Firestore with Firebase. 

I made this project so that I could further my skills in Firebase and be a better contributing member to my team. 


# Cloud Database

Firebase is in use in this project. I am using Firestore and Authentication.

The database is very simple, it just has two tables. One that stores Users' info and one that stores information that users give and their user id for each ride.
